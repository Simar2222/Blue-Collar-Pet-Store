        <h3 class="text-center">Planning to adopt a pet? We'll help you adopt the Perfect Pet for you!</h3>
        <p class="second">Adopting a pet is one of the most exciting things you can do. Taking responsibility for an animal raises a slew of questions: Will I be a good pet parent? Do I have enough time? What if I’m horrible at training?Each and every animal has different needs when it comes to care, behavior, cost, housing, feeding and training. Ready to dive in? Here’s what to consider when you’re thinking about adopting a new pet:</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-3">
                    <i class="fa fa-camera"></i>
                    <h4>1.Consider the Number of People at Home.</h4>
                    <p class="arranging">
                        The first thing you’ll want to think about is how many people you have in your family and their individual needs. Sit down everyone you live with, and talk about how involved (or uninvolved) they want to be in your pet’s life, and how much they’re willing to help you raise it. It’s important to be realistic—the more your friends and family know what they’re getting into, the better for everyone involved.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-3">
                    <i class="fa fa-home"></i>
                    <h4> 2.Assess Your Space.</h4>
                    <p class="arranging"> Now that you know how the people living with you feel about your new furry (or feathered) friend, you’ll want to think about how large or small your pet should be. Smaller apartments mean high-energy dog breeds won’t have room to run around inside and will need more time outside to compensate.It’s also important to consider whether your pet will be sleeping in the same room as you.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-3">
                    <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i>
                    <h4> 3.Contemplate the Relationship You Want with Your Pet.</h4>
                    <p class="arranging">Cats may be super cuddly, but they are far more independent than dogs are and won’t be as excited to see you when you come home after a long day. That being said, most cats are still affectionate and playful, so long as you socialize them at an early age. If you’d prefer more of a pet soul mate, a dog might be right for you. There’s a reason they’re called man’s best friend.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-3">
                    <i class="fa fa-paw"></i>
                    <h4> 4.Consider Your Daily Free Time.</h4>
                    <p class="arranging">One of the biggest differences between pets is how much undivided attention they require. A day with my dogs looks a little like this: My husband and I wake up early to them cuddling with us in bed; we go for our morning walk and they get fed breakfast. The dog walker comes in the afternoon to take them to the dog park. When we get home from work, we go for another walk before they get dinner. More cuddling; then one last walk before bed.</p>
