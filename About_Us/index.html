        <div class="info"> Ponto Pet Store isn't just another pet store. We are pet people, pet lovers and pet parents. We are just like you. When you shop with us, either online or in store, you can feel confident knowing that we wouldn’t sell anything that we wouldn’t give to our own pets.
        <br><br>
        We stock over 8000 stocked lines of pet supplies making us India's largest pet store online offering FREE SHIPPING on orders over Rs 10000 anywhere in India. As proud pet parents ourselves, we know that you want your order fast. That's why when you place a request online with us before 2 p.m. we will try our best to dispatch your order that same day. All orders are sent from our Chandigarh, Delhi and Mumbai dispatch centres, ensuring the quickest delivery times possible.
        <br><br>
        The food we stock for dogs is one of our biggest range, catering for your dogs differing taste buds and needs, including prescription and veterinary lines. Your finicky felines are also well covered with an equally impressive supply of both premium and prescription lines of cat food. Basically, we have everything your pet needs.
        
        <br><br><br>
        <strong>You might be thinking what about actual pets?</strong>
         Although we receive countless enquiries about pets, we do not actually sell pets. Never have, never will. No matter how great a pet shop is, they are not geared up to adequately take care of dogs and cats until they go to their forever home. We believe and support pet adoption through registered breeders and animal shelters. This is a much better approach to finding your new family member. Taking care of an animal is a big commitment and if we had pets in our store we’d have no time left over to look after you, our customers!
